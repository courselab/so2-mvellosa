d) the binary file produced from hwasm.py is identical to the example one (eg-01.asm), as observed by using the command 
    diff -s eg-01.bin eg-01.asm.

e) after disassembling hw.bin, it is possible to see that the output is nearly the same as hw.S file, with the exception of the comments,
    characters as their respective ASCII values, and the labels (as expected).

f) booting the file with qemu shows the expected result (a screen with the phrase "Hello, World") and works as expected.

g) Booting from the thumb drive on the first try was successful, showing only a black screen with the phrase "Hello, World" just like qemu

i) Using the GNU toolchain to compile the hw.S file with the following command: "as --32 hw.S -o hw2.o" and linking with the same command
   as before (ld -melf_i386 --oformat=binary -Ttext=0x7c00 hw2.o -o hw2.bin) produces the same result when running on qemu, showing the
   phrase "Hello, World" on the screen.
   When analising both hw.bin and hw2.bin binary files with the command "diff -s hw.bin hw2.bin", we get the message "Files hw.bin and hw2.bin are identical".
